1) Change the function Generate to do the following:
Return each word from "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" on a new line
Use a string manipulation function to do so
2) Add a new button that is called 'Sort by Words'
This button will take the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and sort all the words alphabetically
This will display each word on a new line
3) Add a new button that is called 'Sort by Length of Word'
This button will take the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and sort the words by their length
This will display each word on a new line
4) Add a new button that is called reverse
Takes the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
This will print each word in reverse but not change their position in the original sentence.
